# Public Feedback Discussions

`Sayches Current Status: Private Beta`

`Angry Fish Current Status: Stable Release`

In this repository, you can find the [official Sayches public feedback discussions](https://github.com/Sayches/feedback/discussions), where you can share suggestions for how the products should be improved and discuss those improvements with the community, including members of the Sayches team.

Discussions here will be limited to the Sayches products. Any discussions opened for other topics will be resolved by redirecting the feedback to the appropriate channel or outright removal in the case of unacceptable behavior.

We encourage you to [open a discussion](https://github.com/Sayches/feedback/discussions) if you have suggestions for how we can improve our products. You don't need to have a solution to the problem you are facing to kick off a discussion. We are hoping to foster productive and collaborative conversations.

Prior to making a new discussion please take a look at previous discussions to see if someone else has already brought to our attention your suggestions. If you find a similar discussion reply with additional details or react to signal your support rather than creating a new discussion.

Once you kick off a discussion the Sayches team will evaluate the feedback but will not be able to respond to every submission. From there, we will work with you, and the entire community, to ensure we understand the current capabilities Sayches doesnâ€™t have and explore the space for potential solutions to your problem statement.
